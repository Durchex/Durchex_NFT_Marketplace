## 🎯 PROJECT SCOPE

### Current State (Before Implementation)
- 75% complete marketplace
- 23 backend API routers working
- 11 frontend pages integrated
- 30+ components created but hidden
- Smart contracts: None for NFT creation
- Database: Missing contract tracking
- UI: Scattered, not discoverable

### Target State (After Implementation)
- 100% production-ready marketplace
- 23+ backend routers functioning
- 25+ frontend pages (11 existing + 14 new)
- All 30+ components integrated and visible
- Smart contracts: ERC-721 per collection
- Database: Full contract tracking
- UI: Discoverable, organized, complete

### Key Transformations
- NFT creation: DB-only → Smart contract deployment
- UI organization: Scattered → Hub-based discovery
- Features: Hidden → Visible and organized
- Standards: Non-standard → OpenSea/Rarible compliant
