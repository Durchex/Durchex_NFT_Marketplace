## 🚨 COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I need to do all 37 tasks?**  
A: Yes, but in phases. Each phase builds on the previous one. Checkpoints gate each phase.

**Q: Can I skip some tasks?**  
A: Only skip tasks if they duplicate features already working. Refer to FEATURE_ANALYSIS_AND_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md first.

**Q: How long will this really take?**  
A: 4 weeks with 2-3 engineers. 5-6 weeks with 1 engineer. 2-3 weeks with 4+ engineers.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Check the guide first (has examples), then QUICK_REFERENCE_CHECKLIST.md, then ask team members.

**Q: Can phases be done in parallel?**  
A: Yes! Phase 2 can start after Day 3 of Phase 1. Phase 3 can start after Phase 2 checkpoint.

**Q: Do I really need to test on testnet first?**  
A: Yes! Always test on Sepolia/Mumbai. Never go directly to mainnet. This prevents costly mistakes.

**Q: What if the timeline slips?**  
A: That's normal. Adjust team size or reduce scope. Refer to ANALYSIS_SUMMARY_AND_ROADMAP.md for alternatives.
